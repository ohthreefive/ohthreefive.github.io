<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This file was created in <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/" title="Working Copy website">Working Copy</a> for iOS. It was then edited in <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/" title="Editorial website">Editorial</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote this text in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown website / explainer">Markdown</a> and converted to HTML using an Editorial workflow.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>I want to see what gets left behind in Editorial and what goes back to Working Copy.</p>
