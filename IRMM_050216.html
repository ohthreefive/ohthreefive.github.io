		<h2>Cases for brief discussion</h2>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p>1. 60 year old patient for PTC. Profound sepsis with shock in
		recovery area after completion of procedure. (0309556430)</p>
		<p><strong>Discussed with next case</strong></p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p>2. 84 year old patient for PTC. Repeated pulsatile
		ventricular tachycardia pre-procedure and defibrillation from
		ICD. Once given Amiodarone and Magnesium, his rate settled and
		he was transferred to coronary care. No further events over next
		five days. Re-attended for procedure but had three further
		shocks on table before starting. (0403313155)</p>
		<p><strong>The sepsis case highlights the importance of the
			consent process as per the death discussed
			above</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Both cases brought into light the unfamiliarity many
			staff have with immediate life support and management of
			them. We should invite the resus team to give us a
			tutorial / refresher. A talk on sepsis management would
			also be useful. MH will try to arrange the
			latter.</strong></p>
	</section>
		
	<section class="slide">
		<p>3. Internal iliac artery covered unintentionally at EVAR
		(0202346218)</p>
		<p><strong>Misinterpreted the double density on the angiogram
			and so incorrectly judged IIA origin</strong></p>
		<p><strong>No untoward outcome (ie. no report of buttock
			claudication since EVAR) so no real morbidity but it's
			included here as a duty of candour issue</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Would likely not have occurred if the iliac run was
			done oblique</p></strong>
		<p><strong>Necessitated another device - bare metal
			stent</p></strong>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide">
		<p>4. EVAR case in which an error in the c-arm delayed the start
		of the case - screening was not possible. Once rebooted twice,
		an unfamiliar error message displayed on screen. However, after
		discussing with Toshiba it was thought safe to proceed with this
		procedure in spite of the error message.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p><strong>The importance of the theatre brief has been
			recognised and has improved a lot since hybrid cases
			have begun</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Worthwhile to add a screening and c-arm movement test
			prior to the first patient being brought in to
			theatre?</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Not ideal to carry out a big case with an error
			message on screen.</p></strong>
		<p><strong>There had been a generator test at the weekend before
			the case. This may have been the cause of the
			problem.</p></strong>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide">
		<p>5. Patient with aortic occlusion and coeliac axis supplying
		all of gut presented for hybrid coeliac axis stent. Very
		challenging procedure. Stent sited eventually but distal
		thrombus seen on subsequent imaging. Patient was given heparin
		during procedure. Died secondary to ischaemia within a few weeks
		of procedure. (2406655520)</p>
		<p><strong>Death not thought directly related to thrombus seen
			at end of procedure. Prognosis was very poor under any
			circumstances.</strong></p>
