<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Situation</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>IR lists at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) are subjectively
becoming increasingly disorganised for a variety of reasons.</li>
<li>Patient safety is at risk and staff morale has been negatively affected.</li>
<li>Current demand for work exceeds capacity and this proposal does not seek to
address this fact at all; this is to improve patient safety and flow in IR for
whatever work is performed.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Background</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Both QEUH IR labs have booked cases every day from Monday to Friday, with the
only routine exceptions being certain Friday mornings where only one lab is in
use.</li>
<li>A list is up to six cases, up to four of which can relate to dialysis access
procedures.</li>
<li>In the hybrid theatres, up to 60% of work involves IR.</li>
<li>This volume of work was not accounted for when planning IR activity was
undertaken.</li>
<li>Few IR lists have vacant slots.</li>
<li>On any given day, new cases of varying urgency and from varying locations may
be referred.</li>
<li>These referrals should be processed in an efficient and consistent manner
while minimising disruption to the current lists.</li>
<li>The current informal arrangements for covering unplanned cases has been
implicated in at least one Serious Clinical Incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Assessment</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Two consultants and up to two registrars are on site at QEUH to consent
patients and perform procedures.</li>
<li>In practice, it is rare for any of these doctors to be able to review patients
on the wards after a procedure.</li>
<li>These doctors often have to deal with referrals, requests for advice or
imaging review, both in person in the IR reporting room and over the
telephone.</li>
<li>There is no single number for clinicians to contact IR, with phones in the IR
reporting room, control room and recovery all receiving clinical queries.</li>
<li>This can disrupt case planning, reporting and other thought processes relating
to procedures about to be performed.</li>
<li>Work is often duplicated. Questions are often duplicated. Answers are often
different.</li>
<li>There are two currently consultants each day to be the &#39;flexible&#39; IR (except
on a Friday morning when there has never been a flexible consultant) one
covering AM and one PM.</li>
<li>The flexible consultant is available to perform QEUH cases in situation where
a third operator may be required or to travel to Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI)
or Gartnavel General Hospital (GGH) to perform urgent procedures on days on
which there is no routine list.</li>
<li>This consultant should also be free for the above referrals etc. but in
practice they are rarely the first to be involved with these unscheduled
events.</li>
<li>The nursing team is split between the recovery area and the labs.</li>
<li>Because the labs are situated between the IR reporting room and recovery,
messages are often passed in a chain through the labs.</li>
<li>Secretaries with responsibility for booking cases are not all based on site.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Response</a></h2>

<p>The IR team should be split in to the lab team, whose priority is the patients
undergoing scheduled procedures, and the duty team, who have an additional role
in streamlining unscheduled care and potentially performing emergency
procedures. Duty IR consultant should replace flexible IR.</p>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">IR duty team</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>A team of one IR doctor, the nurse in charge of recovery and the lead
radiographer for the day should form the IR duty team.</li>
<li>The IR doctor should have a specific phone for the role.</li>
<li>Ideally, this phone should be portable in that it will work in GGH and GRI as
well.</li>
<li>At the least it should work in QEUH.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="#table-of-contents">Duty IR doctor</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Consultant (or 6th year registrar) with no other clinical commitments that
day.</li>
<li>Note, they should not use this session to schedule any cases specific to their
practice.</li>
<li>The duty session lasts from 0900-1700.</li>
<li>The extra session could be claimed from the consultant&#39;s SPA session that
week: as the duty day should only occur fortnightly the surrendered SPA can be
re-claimed the following week.</li>
<li>Duty IR should not take place the day after an on call.</li>
<li>The duty IR doctor will be based in QEUH IR reporting room and should have
access to a PACS workstation.</li>
<li>Exceptions to the above may be to attend an MDT, but duty IR doctor should not
be based in their office or another reporting room, as a significant amount of
interruptions come from physically present clinicians; it is not the job of
the lab IR team to try to locate duty IR in these circumstances or to deal with
the clinician themselves.</li>
<li>Duty IR should attend the daily brief.</li>
<li>Duty IR may have to perform urgent procedures in QEUH but that is not their
main role.</li>
<li>Duty IR may have to travel to other hospitals to perform urgent procedures if
there is no list at that site.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="#table-of-contents">Duty IR nurse and radiographer</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>They should help the duty IR doctor in planning referred cases in terms of
ensuring there is a request, finding an appointment etc.</li>
<li>If the duty doctor is performing a clinical role (eg. performing an urgent
procedure) the nurse or radiographer should take the telephone.</li>
<li>In this situation, the nurse or radiographer would not be expected to have
clinical discussions, but rather they would be able to inform the referrer
that duty IR is unavailable and take an appropriate message.</li>
<li>An exception to this would be truly emergency or life-threatening cases, such
as haemorrhage, which may need immediate discussion, in which case any IR
doctor could be interrupted.</li>
<li>While it may seem more appropriate that the telephone is passed to another
doctor, ie. who is part of the lab IR team, remember both that the point of
this exercise is to protect patients by diverting unnecessary interruptions from
the QEUH lab team and also that the majority of calls do not need immediate
attention.</li>
<li>If the system fell back to its default position at the first hurdle then it
would not be robust.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Morning brief and hand-over</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>At the morning brief, the duty IR doctor, recovery nurse and lead radiographer
should be identified so everyone knows who should take questions etc.</li>
<li>Overnight cases to be handed on should be passed from the on-call consultant
to duty IR before the brief, using the duty telephone.</li>
<li>Duty IR should hand over &#39;side-of-the-board&#39; cases to the on call consultant
around 1700.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Referrals for procedures</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>All telephone and personal referrals should be directed to duty IR, even if
one of the lab IR doctors is currently available.</li>
<li>If a referral is taken, duty IR, together with the recovery nurse and
radiographer, are responsible for prioritising and scheduling the case,
including vetting requests and liaising with secretaries.</li>
<li>Specific information relating to procedures - eg. contact details, names of
referrers etc. - should be recorded in CRIS as this is accessible to everyone
and is easily auditable.</li>
<li>The ideal scenario is that for every referral which truly requires a procedure
some time soon, the referral is concluded by the duty IR team finding an
appropriate appointment for the patient.</li>
<li>Scraps of paper and side-of-the-board scribbles should be avoided for most
cases.</li>
<li>Urgent cases which should be performed at the next available opportunity but
which cannot be specifically scheduled, eg. cases requiring CEPOD anaesthetic
assistance, can be written on the side-of-the-board as they may need to be
handed over (vetting should still be performed.)</li>
<li>Similarly, cases referred from outside GG&amp;C can be recorded here, as they will
not yet have a CRIS entry.</li>
<li>Cases discussed and accepted but awaiting CEPOD anaesthetic support should be
consented by the duty IR doctor taking the referral. While this may mean that
consent is taken by a doctor not ultimately performing the procedure, it should
ensure that all of these cases have valid consent.</li>
<li>The nursing staff, radiographers and IRs responsible for the day&#39;s list should
not be involved in any part of the referral process and should only be
informed if a case is added to the day&#39;s list.</li>
<li>The judgement of the duty IR team should be respected in this regard.</li>
<li>Duty IR doctor should try to summarise an added-on case to a lab IR doctor
(eg. &ldquo;There is a septic nephrostomy which I&#39;ve added. I&#39;ve checked the bloods
etc and everything is good to go. There is space for it this afternoon.&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Lab IR team</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Lab IR doctors, nurses and radiographers should avoid engaging in other
referral or admin-related queries, even in an effort to be helpful.</li>
<li>Clinical questions about patients due to have or having already had procedures
(eg. &ldquo;Do you want to review this groin haematoma?&rdquo;) can be directed to the
relevant lab IR (ie. the one who did the procedure) if they are available but
the majority of these queries will likely go to the duty team. Some judgement
will be required here.</li>
<li>For cases consented immediately prior to recovery, every effort should be made
to ensure the consenting doctor (or supervising consultant for registrar
consent or cases) performs the procedure.</li>
<li>On the other hand, lab IR doctors should not consent multiple recovery
patients at the same time if they know they are unlikely to be performing the
procedure, even if trying to be helpful.</li>
<li>Lab IR doctors, nurses and radiographers should refrain from asking too many
questions about cases going through duty and concentrate on the case in front
of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Emergency cases requiring a third practitioner</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>If two scheduled cases are happening and a third QEUH case needs to be
performed as an emergency, duty IR should perform the case (even if it is more
interesting than the lab IR cases and the lab IR doctor would really quite
like to do it&hellip;)</li>
<li>The duty phone should go to the duty nurse or radiographer: if another
emergency occurs, a doctor currently performing a procedure can be interrupted
(this should be rare.)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Emergency cases requiring IR to travel to another hospital</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Duty IR doctor is expected to travel.</li>
<li>GGH and GRI have radiographers so the duty IR radiographer is likely to stay
in QEUH.</li>
<li>Depending on nursing staff (and potentially on-call staff if the case is near
5pm) the duty IR nurse may or may not have to travel.</li>
<li>The phone should stay in QEUH with either the duty IR nurse or radiographer.</li>
<li>However, as above, duty IR should remain duty IR: calls requiring discussion
can be forwarded to theatre K or GGH or messages taken.</li>
<li>Clinicians who visit in person should be either asked to come back, phone the
hospital where duty IR doctor is or wait until there might be an available lab
IR doctor, though this should be discouraged for routine discussions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Covering absences</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Duty IR doctor should be filled in preference to lab IR doctor, which means
lists will have to be closed.</li>
<li>This is in the interest of patient safety but may impact on waiting times.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Side-of-the-board</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>The side-of-the-board contains patient identifiable information and is freely
visible to any visitors to the department (other clinicians, industry
representatives, Toshiba engineers, interpreters and other frequent visitors.)</li>
<li>Its use to record case details is probably better avoided.</li>
<li>As detailed above, it would be reasonable to use it to record cases where
patients do not yet have a CRIS entry and cases which may need handed on to
the on-call team.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#table-of-contents">Hand-over</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>This should be formalised.</li>
<li>The on-call doctor should phone duty IR doctor to handover any cases and what
action is required.</li>
<li>If there is nothing to handover, a text message or phone call stating so is
preferable to no handover.</li>
<li>The duty IR doctor should phone the on-call doctor around 5pm to handover
pending or possible cases currently on the side-of-the-board.</li>
<li>Ideally, with this handover performed, the board should be wiped clean.</li>
<li>If any of these cases need to be handed back over to next day&#39;s team, it is
the responsibility of the on-call team.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Summary</a></h2>

<p>The suggestions above are intended to improve the safety of patients visiting
the busiest IR site in Glasgow.</p>

<p>Ideal side effects will be improved staff morale as lab teams should be able to
focus on performing scheduled care to the highest standard.</p>

<p>Unscheduled care inherently carries more risks, but with a formal structure in
place to deal with it, this can be minimised.</p>

<p>A negative side-effect is that this will likely have something of a negative
impact on the amount of work performed - a list should be closed in preference
to a duty slot being vacant.</p>

<p>While this may seem unacceptable, consider the anaesthetic team: they prioritise
patient (and team) safety above all else. This often leads to delays, which the
anaesthetic team accept better than anyone else. However, when the anaesthetic
team are fully supporting an IR case, everyone feels like they are in safer
hands.</p>

<p>We should strive to cultivate this atmosphere in IR.</p>
